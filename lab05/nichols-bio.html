    <h1>Yaneeka Nichols Biography</h1>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Yaneeka Nichols. I am a Junior undergraduate at <strong>Syracuse University</strong>, majoring in Information
        Management & Technology with a double concentration in Web Design & Management and Innovation, Design &
        Startups, as well as a minor in Public Communications Studies. My primary interests include web design for
        designer brands and human-interface design for private sector tech companies. I’ve gained experience interning
        as a web designer for the US Army War College’s CMRC program and designing websites for family businesses,
        including real estate and graphic design ventures.

    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
        Outside of my career and academics, I enjoy traveling, reading, and creating art. I love exploring new places
        and keep detailed lists of where I’ve been and where I hope to visit, which helps me plan my next adventures. My
        favorite author is Stephen King, though I also enjoy books that explore life lessons and morals. When it comes
        to art, I find joy in canvas painting and coloring.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Goals & Aspirations</h2>
    <p>
        After graduation, I aim to work in web design for designer fashion brands such as Louis Vuitton, Chanel, or
        Burberry, or to join Apple’s Human Interface Design team, with aspirations of growing into a leadership
        position. Beyond my professional goals, I am always eager to seek new opportunities to expand my knowledge—both
        within my field of study and beyond—while making meaningful contributions to the projects I undertake.
